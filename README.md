# Spaceship Game

My game has multiple rocks and multiple missiles. The player will lose a life if his ship collides with a rock and he will score points if his missile collides with a rock, he will keep track of the score and lives remaining and end the game at the proper time. The game contains animated explosions when there is a collision.

## Utilized
